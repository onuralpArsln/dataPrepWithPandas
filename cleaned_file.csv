history
sarcoidosis.

comparison
xxxx.

findings
heart size and pulmonary vascularity appear within normal limits. bilateral hilar fullness is present consistent with adenopathy. the appearance is unchanged. there is prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally. these are also unchanged. no focal superimposed airspace disease is seen. no pneumothorax or pleural effusion is noted.

impression
. continued hilar fullness consistent with adenopathy and bilateral interstitial opacities. stable as compared to earlier study. the changes are compatible with known diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

findings
the lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with emphysema. the heart size and pulmonary vascularity appear within normal limits. no pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. patchy airspace disease is present in the right middle lobe. degenerative changes are present spine.

impression
. hyperexpanded lungs suggesting emphysema. . patchy right middle lobe airspace disease. may represent pneumonia. followup examination is suggested following treatment to confirm clearing of the opacities. a  to  xxxx post treatment interval film would be reasonable to allow clearing of inflammatory opacities.

impression
no acute osseous abnormalities. if continued clinical concern for rib fracture dedicated rib films will be helpful. left midlung, and left basilar streaky opacity may represent atelectasis.
